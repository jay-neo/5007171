<h2 align="center">Exercise 1: Inventory Management System</h2>

### Scenario: 
You are developing an inventory management system for a warehouse. Efficient data storage and retrieval are crucial.

### Steps:
1. Understand the Problem:
    - Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.
    - Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.

2. Setup:
    - Create a new project for the inventory management system.

3. Implementation:
    - Define a class Product with attributes like `productId`, `productName`, `quantity`, and `price`.
    - Choose an appropriate data structure to store the products (e.g., ArrayList, HashMap).
    - Implement methods to add, update, and delete products from the inventory.

4. Analysis:
    - Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, update, delete) in your chosen data structure.
    - Discuss how you can optimize these operations.

#### Importance of Data Structures and Algorithms in Handling Large Inventories:

- Efficient Data Storage and Retrieval: As the size of the inventory grows, efficient data structures ensure that operations like adding, updating, and retrieving products are performed quickly.
- Optimized Performance: Algorithms help in optimizing the performance of operations, making the system responsive even with a large number of products.
- Resource Management: Proper data structures help in efficient memory usage, which is crucial for handling large datasets.



### Suitable Data Structures for Inventory Management:

- ArrayList: Good for maintaining a list of products where order matters. Provides quick access by index but slower for search, add, and delete operations.
- HashMap: Excellent for fast lookup, insertion, and deletion operations using a key (e.g., productId). Ideal for inventory management where each product has a unique identifier.


### Testing

```java
javac inventory/*.java
```

```java
java inventory.Testing
```



### Analysis

<table align="center">
    <tr>
        <th>Operation</th>
        <th>Time Complexity</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Add</td>
        <td>O(1)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Update</td>
        <td>O(1)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Delete</td>
        <td>O(1)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Optimization:
- Ensure Proper Hashing: To maintain O(1) performance, it's crucial to have a good hash function to minimize collisions.
- Load Factor: Adjusting the load factor of the HashMap can help in optimizing memory usage and performance.
- Concurrency: For a multi-threaded environment, consider using ConcurrentHashMap to handle concurrent access efficiently.
