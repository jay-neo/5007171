<h2 align="center">Exercise 6: Configuring Beans with Annotations</h2>

### Scenario: 
You need to simplify the configuration of beans in the library management application using annotations.


### Steps:
1. Enable Component Scanning:
    - Update applicationContext.xml to include component scanning for the com.library package.
2. Annotate Classes:
    - Use @Service annotation for the BookService class.
    - Use @Repository annotation for the BookRepository class.
3. Test the Configuration:
    - Run the LibraryManagementApplication main class to verify the annotation-based configuration.
