<h2 align="center">Exercise 8: Implementing Basic AOP with Spring</h2>

### Scenario: 
The library management application requires basic AOP functionality to separate cross-cutting concerns like logging and transaction management.


### Steps:
1. Define an Aspect:
    - Create a package com.library.aspect and add a class LoggingAspect.
2. Create Advice Methods:
    - Define advice methods in LoggingAspect for logging before and after method execution.
3. Configure the Aspect:
    - Update applicationContext.xml to register the aspect and enable AspectJ auto-proxying.
4. Test the Aspect:
    - Run the LibraryManagementApplication main class to verify the AOP functionality.
